# Janus

## Description

My motivation for doing this project was to show off my newfound React skills and show that I can make an amazing portfolio.
I built this portfolio to showcase all of the projects I have created in the past 6 months utilizing different languages in the front and back-end.
With this portfolio, employers can view all of the different projects that I have created.
Overall, I was able to learn the core elements to make a front-end application with React.
