                Hey! My name is Lorenzo Olivar, but you can call me Zo.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based in California, I started my journey as a web developer at the University of California, Berkeley! Although I'm just a beginner, I am excited to have so many years ahead of me to learn, grow, and to be confident as a developer.
