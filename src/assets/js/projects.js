        fullDescription: `Just Another Text Editor (J.A.T.E) is a text editor that stores code snippets or texts you might keep for yourself. This project helped me practice making full-stack applications as installable apps. Jate helps me store code that I plan to use in all my projects so I can work smarter and not harder! From this project, I learned how to structure my code into a server and client format while learning how to cache my application so I can use the app without the internet.`,

        fullDescription: `My motivation in creating this project was to make a simple and easy-to-use block-style scheduler for the user to use in their daily lives.
        I built this project to familiarize myself with the use of third-party APIs and their functions.
        Thankfully, this scheduler helps with organizing an individual's busy life by assigning events and things to do at a specific time.
        Overall, I learned how beneficial it is to utilize third-party APIs to be more efficient when coding.`,
